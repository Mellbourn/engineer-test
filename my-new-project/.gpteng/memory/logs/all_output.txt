================================ System Message ================================

You will get instructions for code to write.
You will write a very long answer. Make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code.
Think step by step and reason yourself to the correct decisions to make sure we get it right.
First lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, As well as a quick comment on their purpose.

You will output the content of each file necessary to achieve the goal, including ALL code.
Represent files like so:

FILENAME
```
CODE
```

The following tokens must be replaced like so:
FILENAME is the lowercase combined path and file name including the file extension
CODE is the code in the file

Example representation of a file:

src/hello_world.py
```
print("Hello World")
```

Do not comment on what every file does. Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.


You will start with the "entrypoint" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.
Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.

Follow a language and framework appropriate best practice file naming convention.
Make sure that files contain all imports, types etc.  The code should be fully functional. Make sure that code in different files are compatible with each other.
Ensure to implement all code, if you are unsure, write a plausible implementation.
Include module dependency or package manager dependency definition file.
Before you finish, double check that all parts of the architecture is present in the files.

When you are done, write finish with "this concludes a fully working implementation".

Useful to know:
Almost always put different classes in different files.
Always use the programming language the user asks for.
For Python, you always create an appropriate requirements.txt file.
For NodeJS, you always create an appropriate package.json file.
Always add a comment briefly describing the purpose of the function definition.
Add comments explaining very complex bits of logic.
Always follow the best practices for the requested languages for folder/file structure and how to package the project.

================================ Human Message =================================

Request: a todo app that lets the user add todo items, creating a list, and then lets the user check off tasks in the todo list that have been done

================================== Ai Message ==================================

To create a fully functional Todo app in Python, we'll use the following architecture:

1. **Core Classes and Functions:**
   - `TodoItem`: Represents a single todo item.
   - `TodoList`: Manages a list of todo items.
   - `TodoApp`: Main application class to interact with the user.
   - `main()`: Entry point function to run the application.

2. **Files and Structure:**
   - `src/todo_item.py`: Contains the `TodoItem` class.
   - `src/todo_list.py`: Contains the `TodoList` class.
   - `src/todo_app.py`: Contains the `TodoApp` class.
   - `src/main.py`: Entry point of the application.
   - `requirements.txt`: Lists the dependencies for the project.

Let's start with the implementation:

### src/todo_item.py
```
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class TodoItem:
    description: str
    completed: bool = False

    def mark_completed(self):
        """Mark the todo item as completed."""
        self.completed = True
```

### src/todo_list.py
```
from typing import List
from src.todo_item import TodoItem

class TodoList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items: List[TodoItem] = []

    def add_item(self, description: str):
        """Add a new todo item to the list."""
        item = TodoItem(description)
        self.items.append(item)

    def mark_item_completed(self, index: int):
        """Mark a specific todo item as completed by its index."""
        if 0 <= index < len(self.items):
            self.items[index].mark_completed()

    def get_items(self) -> List[TodoItem]:
        """Get the list of todo items."""
        return self.items
```

### src/todo_app.py
```
from src.todo_list import TodoList

class TodoApp:
    def __init__(self):
        self.todo_list = TodoList()

    def run(self):
        """Run the main loop of the todo application."""
        while True:
            print("\nTodo List:")
            for idx, item in enumerate(self.todo_list.get_items()):
                status = "Done" if item.completed else "Pending"
                print(f"{idx + 1}. {item.description} [{status}]")

            print("\nOptions:")
            print("1. Add a new todo item")
            print("2. Mark a todo item as completed")
            print("3. Exit")

            choice = input("Choose an option: ")

            if choice == "1":
                description = input("Enter the description of the new todo item: ")
                self.todo_list.add_item(description)
            elif choice == "2":
                index = int(input("Enter the number of the todo item to mark as completed: ")) - 1
                self.todo_list.mark_item_completed(index)
            elif choice == "3":
                break
            else:
                print("Invalid option. Please try again.")
```

### src/main.py
```
from src.todo_app import TodoApp

def main():
    app = TodoApp()
    app.run()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### requirements.txt
```
dataclasses
```

This concludes a fully working implementation.
